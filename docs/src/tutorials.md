## Getting Started

- [Getting Started with Graphons](tutorials/01_simple_graphon.md) - Learn the
  basics of graphon models, how to define simple continuous graphons, and
  sample random graphs from them.

- [Stochastic Block Models](tutorials/03_block_models.md) - Explore block
  models with community structure, core-periphery patterns, and hierarchical
  organization. Learn how to discretize continuous graphons.

## Advanced Topics

- [Multiplex Networks with Decorated Graphons](tutorials/02_multiplex_networks.md) -
  Explore decorated graphons for modeling multiplex networks with multiple edge
  types or layers, including marginal probabilities and cross-layer
  correlations.
